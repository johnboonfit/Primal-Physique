# Primal Physique

A coaching app built with [Expo](https://expo.dev) (React Native) and [Supabase](https://supabase.com). Right now it does one thing: let someone create an account as either a **coach** or a **client**, log in, and land on a home screen that shows which role they're logged in as. Everything else gets built on top of this.

## How it fits together

- **Expo Router** (`src/app/`) handles navigation using folders as routes:
  - `src/app/index.tsx` — checks if you're logged in and sends you to `/login` or `/home`.
  - `src/app/(auth)/` — the `login` and `signup` screens (only reachable when logged out).
  - `src/app/(app)/` — the `home` screen (only reachable when logged in).
- **`src/lib/supabase.ts`** — the Supabase client the whole app talks through.
- **`src/context/auth-context.tsx`** — tracks whether you're logged in and fetches your role from the database.
- **`supabase/schema.sql`** — the database setup: a `profiles` table (id, email, role) plus a trigger that creates a profile row automatically whenever someone signs up.

## One-time setup

### 1. Create a Supabase project

Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), create a free account, then create a new project. Wait for it to finish provisioning (a couple of minutes).

### 2. Run the database setup

In the Supabase dashboard: **SQL Editor** → **New query** → paste the entire contents of `supabase/schema.sql` → **Run**.

Verify it worked: go to **Table Editor** and confirm you see a `profiles` table with columns `id`, `email`, `role`, `created_at`.

### 3. Turn off email confirmation (for now)

By default, Supabase makes new users confirm their email before they can log in. That's the right setting for production, but it slows down testing. To switch it off while you're building: **Authentication** → **Sign In / Providers** → **Email** → turn off **"Confirm email"** → **Save**.

(You can turn this back on later before real users sign up.)

### 4. Get your project's API keys

**Project Settings** → **API**. You need two values:
- **Project URL**
- **anon / public key**

### 5. Configure the app

In the project folder, copy the example env file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and paste in your Project URL and anon key:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
```

`.env` is gitignored — it won't get committed.

### 6. Install dependencies (if you haven't already)

```bash
npm install
```

### 7. Start the app

```bash
npx expo start
```

This prints a QR code and a menu. Press `w` to open it in a web browser (fastest way to test), or scan the QR code with the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on your phone.

## Verifying it works

1. **Sign up as a client.** On the signup screen, leave the toggle on "Client", enter an email and a password (6+ characters), and submit. You should land straight on the home screen (no email confirmation needed, since we turned that off) reading **"You're logged in as Client."**
2. **Check the database.** In Supabase's Table Editor, open `profiles` — you should see a new row with that email and `role = client`.
3. **Sign out and sign up again as a coach.** Use a different email, switch the toggle to "Coach" before submitting. The home screen should now say **"You're logged in as Coach."**, and a second row should appear in `profiles` with `role = coach`.
4. **Log out and log back in.** Confirm the sign-out button on the home screen returns you to the login screen, and that logging back in with either account takes you straight to home showing the correct role.

If any of those don't match, that's the thing to fix before building further — everything downstream (coach dashboards, client views, etc.) depends on this working correctly.

## Coach: creating workouts

Run `supabase/workouts.sql` in the SQL Editor (same way as `schema.sql`) to add the `workouts` and `workout_exercises` tables. This is additive — run it after `schema.sql`, not instead of it.

Log in as a coach account and the home screen now shows a **"My Workouts"** link (client accounts don't see it — the workouts screens are coach-only, enforced both by the app's routing and by the database's row-level security). From there:

- **+ New** opens a form: a workout name field, one or more exercise rows (each just a name and a sets/reps string like `3x10`), a way to add more rows, and **Save workout**.
- Saving takes you back to the list, which now shows the new workout with its exercise count.

**Verify it works:**

1. Log in as your coach account, tap **My Workouts**, tap **+ New**.
2. Name it "Push Day", add two exercises (e.g. "Bench Press" / "3x10" and "Overhead Press" / "3x12"), tap **Save workout**.
3. You should land back on the list and see "Push Day — 2 exercises".
4. In Supabase's Table Editor, open `workouts` — confirm a row with that name and your coach account's id in `coach_id`. Open `workout_exercises` — confirm two rows pointing at that workout's id.
5. Log in as a client account and confirm there's no "My Workouts" link on home, and that typing `/workouts` into the URL bar (if testing on web) redirects back to home instead of showing the list.

## Coach: assigning a workout to a client

Run `supabase/assignments.sql` in the SQL Editor after `schema.sql` and `workouts.sql`. This adds an `assignments` table (workout + client + date) and one extra rule that lets a coach see the list of client accounts — before this, a coach could only see their own profile row.

Log in as a coach and the home screen now also shows an **Assignments** link. From there:

- **+ New** shows your saved workouts as a tappable list, all client accounts as a tappable list, and a date field (pre-filled with today, editable as `YYYY-MM-DD`). Pick one of each and tap **Save assignment**.
- Saving takes you back to the list, which now shows the assignment as "workout name — client email · date".

Note: there's no coach/client roster yet, so every coach currently sees every client account in the picker. Fine for testing; this is the same simplification flagged when workouts shipped, and needs tightening before multiple coaches are using this for real.

**Verify it works:**

1. Make sure you have at least one saved workout (e.g. "Push Day" from the previous step) and at least one client account signed up.
2. Log in as your coach account, tap **Assignments**, tap **+ New**.
3. Pick "Push Day", pick your client's email, leave today's date (or change it), tap **Save assignment**.
4. You should land back on the list and see "Push Day — [client email] · [date]".
5. In Supabase's Table Editor, open `assignments` — confirm one row with the right `coach_id`, `client_id`, `workout_id`, and `assigned_date`.
6. Log in as the client account and confirm there's no "Assignments" link, and that typing `/assignments` into the URL bar redirects back to home.

## Client: seeing assigned workouts

Run `supabase/client-access.sql` in the SQL Editor after `schema.sql`, `workouts.sql`, and `assignments.sql`. This adds read-only rules letting a client see their own assignments and the workout + exercises linked to each one — before this, a client could only see their own profile row.

Log in as a client and the home screen now shows a **"Your assigned workouts"** section directly (no extra link to tap — it's right there), listing each assignment as "workout name / date". Tapping one opens a detail screen showing every exercise in that workout (name + sets/reps), read-only — no logging sets or marking anything done yet, that's a later chunk.

**Verify it works:**

1. Make sure a workout is already assigned to your client account (from the previous step).
2. Log in as that client account. On home, confirm **"Your assigned workouts"** shows "Push Day / [date]".
3. Tap it — confirm the detail screen shows "Push Day" and both exercises ("Bench Press — 3x10", "Overhead Press — 3x12").
4. Tap **Back**, confirm it returns to home.
5. Log in as a *different* client account (one nothing has been assigned to) and confirm it shows "Nothing assigned yet." instead of someone else's workout.

## Client: logging actual performance

Run `supabase/workout-logs.sql` in the SQL Editor after `client-access.sql`. This adds a `status` column to `assignments` (`pending` or `completed`, defaulting to `pending`), a new `workout_logs` table (one row per exercise actually logged — weight + reps), and permission for a client to flip their own assignment to `completed`.

On the assigned-workout detail screen, each exercise now shows two number inputs (Weight, Reps) instead of nothing — both start empty, and either can be left blank. A **Mark Complete** button at the bottom saves whatever was entered and flips the assignment to completed. Once completed, reopening that screen replaces the inputs with the logged numbers, read-only, and the button disappears — there's no editing a log after it's submitted (a later chunk if you want it).

**Verify it works:**

1. Log in as the client account with "Push Day" assigned (should still show "Pending" if you haven't completed it yet).
2. Open it, enter weight/reps for one exercise (e.g. "135" / "10") and leave the other blank, tap **Mark Complete**.
3. The screen should now show "Completed" next to the date, "Logged: 135 weight · 10 reps" for the one you filled in, and "Logged: — weight · — reps" for the one you left blank. No inputs, no button.
4. Tap Back, tap the same assignment again from home — confirm it still shows the same logged values (not blank inputs), proving it saved rather than just updating on-screen.
5. In Supabase's Table Editor: open `assignments`, confirm that row's `status` is now `completed`. Open `workout_logs`, confirm exactly one row (for the exercise you filled in — the blank one shouldn't have created a row), with the right `assignment_id`, `client_id`, `exercise_id`, `weight`, and `reps`.

## Coach: seeing completed workouts

Run `supabase/coach-log-visibility.sql` in the SQL Editor after `workout-logs.sql`. This adds one read-only rule letting a coach see the `workout_logs` rows tied to their own assignments — before this, only the client who logged them could see them.

The coach's Assignments list now shows each row's status ("Pending" or "Completed"), and every row is tappable — it opens a detail screen showing, per exercise, what was **Prescribed** (the sets/reps set when the workout was built) next to what was **Actual** (what the client logged). For a still-pending assignment, it shows a note that the client hasn't logged it yet instead of actual numbers.

**Verify it works:**

1. Log in as your coach account, tap **Assignments**. Confirm the "Push Day" row you completed as the client earlier now shows **Completed**, and any other assignment still shows **Pending**.
2. Tap the completed one — confirm the detail screen shows the client's email, the date, "Completed", and for each exercise both "Prescribed: 3x10" (or whatever it was set to) and "Actual: 135 weight · 10 reps" (matching what the client logged) — plus "Actual: — weight · — reps" for the one left blank.
3. Tap **Back**, tap a **Pending** assignment instead — confirm it shows "The client hasn't logged this workout yet." and no actual numbers.

## Client: main navigation and home dashboard

Run `supabase/client-name.sql` in the SQL Editor after `coach-log-visibility.sql`. This adds a `full_name` column to `profiles` and updates the signup trigger to save it — needed so the dashboard can greet a client by name.

**This changes where things live.** The client no longer shares the coach's `/home` screen — logging in as a client now goes straight to a 5-tab layout:

- **Home** — a real dashboard: "Good morning/afternoon/evening, [name]" (based on the time on your device), and an **Up Next** section listing pending assignments, each with a **Start** button that opens the same workout-logging screen from Chunk 4/5.
- **Training** — the client's full assignment history, pending and completed, with a status badge on each row (this is what used to be the whole client home screen, moved here).
- **Nutrition**, **Progress**, **Calendar** — placeholders that just say "Coming soon."

Sign-out moved too — it's now a small link at the top of the Home tab, since there's no shared screen to put it on anymore.

Note: **signup now asks for a name**, required for new accounts going forward. Any account created *before* this change has a blank name in the database — the dashboard falls back to using their email in that case, so nothing breaks, but their greeting will read like "Good morning, jane" instead of "Good morning, Jane." Nothing to do about that except having them (or you, in Supabase's Table Editor) fill in `full_name` on `profiles` by hand if it bothers you.

**Verify it works:**

1. Sign up a **brand new** client account so you can test the name field — fill in a full name this time.
2. Confirm it lands straight on a screen with 5 tabs at the bottom: Home, Training, Nutrition, Progress, Calendar.
3. On Home, confirm the greeting matches the current time of day and shows the name you typed.
4. Have your coach account assign a workout to this new client (same flow as before), then pull-to-refresh isn't needed — just leave and come back to the Home tab, and confirm it now appears under **Up Next**.
5. Tap **Start** on it — confirm it opens the same logging screen as before, log some numbers, tap **Mark Complete**.
6. Go to the **Training** tab — confirm that same workout now shows there marked **Completed**, alongside any others still **Pending**.
7. Tap **Nutrition**, **Progress**, and **Calendar** — confirm each just shows its name and "Coming soon."
8. Tap **Sign out** on the Home tab — confirm it returns to the login screen.
9. Log in as your **coach** account and confirm nothing changed there — still the plain Home screen with My Workouts and Assignments links, no tabs.

## Brand theme

This was a purely visual pass — no database changes, no new SQL file, no data or logic changed. One color/spacing/typography system now drives every screen from a single file, `src/constants/theme.ts`:

- **Carbon black** (`#0A0A0A`) background everywhere.
- **Bone white** (`#F5F3EF`) body text everywhere.
- **Oxblood** (`#6B0F1A`) — buttons and active/selected states only (Log in, Create account, Save, Mark Complete, Start, +New, the selected Client/Coach toggle, the active tab). Never used for plain status text.
- **Deep teal** (`#0F3D3E`) — the surface color behind every oversized "hero number" stat card.
- **Bright teal** (`#2E8B8B`) — small accents only: the thin stripe across the top of each stat card, and "Completed" status labels (moved off oxblood, since a status label is data, not an action).
- A soft **teal glow** sits behind every hero-number card; a soft **oxblood glow** sits behind every primary button and the active tab.

New "hero number" stat cards appear at the top of every list-style screen — the coach's My Workouts and Assignments lists, and the client's Home and Training tabs — each showing an oversized count (workouts created, assignments made, workouts up next, workouts assigned) in a glowing teal card, so that number reads as the dominant thing on the screen rather than competing equally with the list below it.

One structural note: **the app no longer follows your device's light/dark setting.** It always renders this one dark brand theme now, regardless of system preference — that's what "one theme file" + a fixed color list means in practice. If you ever want the option to follow system light/dark again later, that's a separate, larger piece of work; flag it if you want it.

**Verify it applied consistently — check every screen, not just one:**

1. **Login and signup** — carbon black background, bone white "Primal Physique" / "Create account" heading, oxblood **Log in** / **Create account** buttons with a visible soft red glow, oxblood "Sign up" / "Log in" links. On signup, tap between Client/Coach — the selected pill should be oxblood-filled with a glow, the unselected one plain dark grey.
2. **Coach home** — unchanged layout, but confirm the "Coach" role highlight and the Sign out button's outline now read oxblood, and body text is bone white.
3. **My Workouts (coach)** — a hero number at the top ("workouts created" count) in a glowing teal card, the **+ New** button oxblood with a glow, workout rows in plain quiet dark cards (not teal — only the hero card is teal).
4. **New workout screen** — same input/button styling as signup; **Save workout** button oxblood with glow.
5. **Assignments (coach)** — hero number card ("assignments made"), **+ New** oxblood/glow, and each row's status label: **Pending** in muted grey, **Completed** in bright teal (not oxblood).
6. **Assignment detail (coach)** — status label same teal-for-completed rule; Prescribed/Actual text in plain bone white (no stray colors).
7. **Client Home tab** — greeting in bone white, a hero number card ("Workouts Up Next"), each Up Next row's **Start** button oxblood with glow.
8. **Client Training tab** — hero number card ("Workouts Assigned"), same Pending-grey / Completed-teal status rule as the coach's list.
9. **Client Nutrition / Progress / Calendar tabs** — plain carbon black background, bone white text, nothing else (these are still just placeholders).
10. **Workout logging screen** (`Start` or tapping any assignment) — inputs styled consistently with every other form in the app; **Mark Complete** oxblood with glow; once completed, the status label reads teal, not oxblood.
11. **Bottom tab bar** (client only) — inactive tabs in muted grey, the active tab in oxblood text with a faint oxblood-tinted pill behind it.

If any screen still shows a plain grey/white button, a hardcoded blue link, or a status label in red instead of teal, that's the one screen that got missed — tell me which one and I'll fix just that spot rather than re-touching everything.

## Brand logo

The logo (`assets/images/logo.jpg`) is mounted once, in the root layout, as a fixed overlay — not something added to each screen individually, which is what guarantees it's on literally every screen without exception. It's small (26×26), sits just inside the top-left safe-area corner, and is rendered with no tint or recolor — exactly the file as provided.

**Verify it works:**

1. On any screen, confirm the logo appears top-left, in its original red/black colors (not shifted teal or any other app color).
2. Navigate through several different screens (login → signup → coach home → workouts → assignments → client tabs) and confirm it's in the exact same spot every time — it shouldn't shift, resize, or disappear anywhere.
3. **Specifically check the screens whose content starts right at the top-left** — My Workouts, Assignments, the client's Home and Training tabs, and the New Workout/New Assignment forms. I verified the login and signup screens render cleanly myself (their content is centered, so there was no risk there), but I couldn't check these top-anchored screens without a live login session. If the logo visually touches or overlaps any heading/text on those, tell me which screen and I'll add clearance there.

## Client: basic food logging

Run `supabase/food-logs.sql` in the SQL Editor after `client-name.sql`. This adds a `food_logs` table — one row per food entry, tied to a client, a date, and a meal (`breakfast`, `lunch`, `dinner`, or `snacks`). Locked down so a client can only see and add their own entries; nobody else's, including their coach.

The **Nutrition** tab is no longer a placeholder. It shows today's date, a hero number for total calories logged today, and four sections (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks). Tapping **+ Add** under any section opens a small popup — food name and calories, both required — and saving adds it to that section's list and updates the running total immediately.

Note: entries are tied to **today's date only** — there's no way yet to view or add to a past day, and no way to edit or delete an entry once saved. Both are natural next steps if you want them; flagging rather than assuming.

**Verify it works:**

1. Log in as a client, tap the **Nutrition** tab. Confirm today's date shows, the hero number reads **0**, and all four sections say "Nothing logged yet."
2. Tap **+ Add** under **Breakfast**, enter "Oatmeal" and "350", tap **Save**. Confirm the popup closes, "Oatmeal — 350 cal" appears under Breakfast, Breakfast's subtotal shows "350 cal", and the hero number at the top updates to **350**.
3. Add a second entry under **Lunch** (e.g. "Chicken Salad" / "450"). Confirm the hero number updates to **800**, and Lunch shows its own entry and subtotal separately from Breakfast.
4. In Supabase's Table Editor, open `food_logs` — confirm two rows, both with today's date, the right `client_id`, correct `meal` values (`breakfast`/`lunch`), and matching `food_name`/`calories`.
5. Leave the Nutrition tab (tap another tab) and come back — confirm both entries and the running total are still there (proving it's reading from the database, not just local state).
6. Log in as a different client account and confirm their Nutrition tab starts empty — these entries don't leak between clients.
